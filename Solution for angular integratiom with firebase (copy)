Steps:


Setting up the Angular Project
 In the console, run:

ng new myproject
cd myproject

Once you're in the new project folder, we need to install AngularFire2:

npm install angularfire2 firebase --save


For generating componenet:-

ng generate component login


Run it!
Now it's time to give it a go! In the console, simply type:

ng serve


And visit your browser at http://localhost:4200


Error Fixes:

For Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise

 solution for that is npm install rxjs@6 rxjs-compat@6 --save
